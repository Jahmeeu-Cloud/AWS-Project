Weâ€™ll use AWS GPU to host OkeyAI so it runs faster and handles more users at once. The GPU helps with heavy AI tasks like generating responses and processing images smoothly.  

how can I deploy this application on AWS, give me step by step to deploy.


Alright, this is exciting! ðŸš€  
You want to **deploy an AI application (like OkeyAI)** using a **GPU-powered AWS server** â€” so it can run **faster** and **handle more users**.

I'll give you a clear, beginner-friendly **step-by-step guide** on how to deploy it on AWS, using the right GPU setup.

# ðŸ“œ How to Deploy Your AI App (OkeyAI) on AWS with GPU

---

## 1. **Choose the Right AWS EC2 Instance (GPU Type)**

- Log in to your **AWS Console**.
- Go to **EC2 > Launch Instance**.
- Pick an AMI (Amazon Machine Image):
  - **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** (easy and stable for AI apps)

- **Choose Instance Type**:
  - For GPU, select:
    - **g4dn.xlarge** (NVIDIA T4 GPU, affordable for AI inferencing)
    - or **g5.xlarge** if you need better performance.
  - These instances have **NVIDIA GPUs** optimized for AI workloads.

âœ… Don't forget to check "Request service limit increase" if you don't see GPU instances available in your region.

---

## 2. **Set Up Security Group (Allow Access)**

- Create a security group:
  - Allow **SSH (port 22)** â€” for you to connect.
  - Allow **HTTP (port 80)** â€” if it's a web app.
  - Allow **HTTPS (port 443)** â€” if youâ€™re using SSL.

âœ… Keep SSH restricted to **your IP address** for security!

---

## 3. **Launch and Connect to the Instance**

- Launch the instance.
- SSH into it:
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

---

## 4. **Install Required Drivers (NVIDIA and CUDA)**

Your instance needs the GPU drivers!

Run this on the server:

```bash
# Update server
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install NVIDIA Driver
curl https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2204.pin | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600

sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/ /"

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cuda-drivers

# Reboot to apply
sudo reboot
```

âœ… After reboot, check GPU is ready:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

You should see the GPU recognized!

---

## 5. **Install Your App Requirements**

Depending on what OkeyAI uses (probably Python, Node.js, or some backend framework):

Install Python, pip, virtualenv:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install AI libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers flask fastapi uvicorn
```
(or whatever frameworks your app uses)

---

## 6. **Deploy Your Application**

Clone your app repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/okeyai.git
cd okeyai
```

Run your app:

```bash
python app.py
```
or
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

âœ… Now your app is **live** on the EC2's public IP!

---

## 7. **(Optional) Set Up NGINX Reverse Proxy (Production Ready)**

To make it production-grade, install NGINX:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

Set up a proxy to forward HTTP requests to your app.

Edit NGINX config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Example config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-ec2-public-ip;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Reload NGINX:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

âœ… Now you can just visit `http://your-ec2-ip` in your browser!

# ðŸŽ¯ Summary

| Step | Task |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Launch GPU instance |
| 2 | Set up security |
| 3 | SSH into server |
| 4 | Install GPU drivers |
| 5 | Install app dependencies |
| 6 | Run your AI app |
| 7 | (Optional) Use NGINX for production |

---

# âš¡ Tips:
- Always monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`.
- Auto-start your app on reboot with **PM2** or **systemd**.
- Use **Elastic IP** if you want a fixed public IP address.
- For scaling, consider setting up **Auto Scaling Groups** or **ECS** later.

Would you also like me to show you how to **automate this whole thing with Terraform** or **create a reusable AMI** so you can launch new GPU servers instantly? ðŸš€  
(Really helpful if you plan to grow!)
