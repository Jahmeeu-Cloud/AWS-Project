ðŸŒŸ Automating Backups with Bash Scripting - Day 2! ðŸŒŸ

As part of my journey to enhance automation skills in cloud engineering, I worked on a Bash script that simplifies and secures the backup process. Here's what it does:

âœ… Creates Timestamped Backups: Automatically generates a backup folder with a precise timestamp for clear organization.

 âœ… Efficient File Synchronization: Uses rsync to copy files seamlessly into the backup directory.

 âœ… Retention Management: Maintains only the latest 3 backups by removing older ones automatically.

 âœ… Error Handling: Ensures dependencies like rsync are installed and provides clear instructions if they aren't.

This script is a step toward ensuring data integrity, optimizing storage usage, and automating repetitive tasksâ€”key elements in a professional cloud environment. ðŸš€

Iâ€™m excited about applying such automation techniques in cloud infrastructure projects to streamline operations and improve efficiency.
