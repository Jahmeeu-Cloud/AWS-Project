### Automating User Account Management with Bash Scripting  

Managing user accounts efficiently is a critical task for system administrators and cloud engineers. Whether youâ€™re working on a standalone server or managing a fleet of cloud-based instances, automating user account management can save time, reduce errors, and enhance system security.  

In this post, Iâ€™m sharing a Bash script I recently developed to simplify and automate user account management tasks on Linux systems.  

### **Here is the Bash Script code:** 

```
#!/bin/bash

# User Account Management Script
# This script provides options for managing user accounts on the system.

# Function to display usage information
usage() {
    echo "Usage: $0 [OPTION]"
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  -c, --create      Create a new user account"
    echo "  -d, --delete      Delete an existing user account"
    echo "  -r, --reset       Reset the password of an existing user account"
    echo "  -l, --list        List all user accounts"
    echo "  -h, --help        Display this help message"
}

# Function to create a new user account
create_user() {
    read -p "Enter the new username: " username
    if id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "Error: The username '$username' already exists."
        exit 1
    fi
    read -s -p "Enter the password for the new user: " password
    echo
    sudo useradd -m "$username"
    echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
    echo "User '$username' created successfully."
}

# Function to delete a user account
delete_user() {
    read -p "Enter the username to delete: " username
    if ! id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "Error: The username '$username' does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi
    sudo userdel -r "$username"
    echo "User '$username' deleted successfully."
}

# Function to reset a user account password
reset_password() {
    read -p "Enter the username to reset the password for: " username
    if ! id "$username" &>/dev/null; then
        echo "Error: The username '$username' does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi
    read -s -p "Enter the new password: " password
    echo
    echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
    echo "Password for user '$username' updated successfully."
}

# Function to list all user accounts
list_users() {
    echo "Listing all user accounts:"
    awk -F: '{print "Username: " $1 ", UID: " $3}' /etc/passwd
}

# Main script logic
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    usage
    exit 1
fi

case "$1" in
    -c|--create)
        create_user
        ;;
    -d|--delete)
        delete_user
        ;;
    -r|--reset)
        reset_password
        ;;

        list_users
        ;;

        usage

    *)
        echo "Invalid option: $1"
        usage
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

### **Features of the Script**  

#### 1. **Create Accounts**  
The script allows administrators to quickly add new user accounts. It ensures that usernames are unique, prompts for secure password creation, and provides a success confirmation after the account is created.

#### 2. **Delete Accounts**  
Removing unnecessary user accounts is made effortless with this feature. The script verifies the existence of the account before deletion and safely removes the user, along with associated files.

#### 3. **Reset Passwords**  
Resetting a userâ€™s password is as simple as entering a username and the new password. The script ensures that only valid accounts are updated, maintaining system integrity.  

Check the above picture.


#### 4. **List User Accounts**  
This feature lists all existing system accounts along with their UIDs, offering administrators a quick overview of the systemâ€™s users.

#### 5. **Help Menu**  
An intuitive help menu guides users through the scriptâ€™s functionality, making it accessible even for those with limited Bash scripting experience.

### **Code Walkthrough**  

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the script:  
- **Input Validation**: The script checks user input to ensure commands are used correctly.  
- **Error Handling**: It gracefully handles errors like missing or duplicate usernames.  
- **Built-in Variables**: Leveraging system variables ensures accurate and dynamic outputs.  
- **Case Statement**: A clean and modular design using a `case` statement makes the script easy to maintain and extend.  




### **Why Automate User Account Management?**  
Manual user account management is prone to errors and inefficiencies. This script:  
- Saves time by automating repetitive tasks.  
- Reduces security risks by enforcing proper account handling practices.  
- Enhances productivity by streamlining administrative workflows.  

Here is the snapshot of the code I pushed to my Github repository:
